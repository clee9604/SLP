chown command is for change ownership of file's ownership. Also change the ownership of a file to matching user or group of existing file.
chgrp command is change the group's ownership of a file or directory.

chown is for "owner" and chgrp is for "group"

I would use chown for change owner to professor like "chown cumoja1 My\ Hunger\ Games.txt
I would use chgrp as "chgrp CSC3320 My\ Hunger\ Games.txt"
