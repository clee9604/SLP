1.	Use mkdir to create folder “Submissions”
2.	Fix restricting by chmod
chown command is for change ownership of file's ownership. Also change the ownership of a file to matching user or group of existing file.
chgrp command is change the group's ownership of a file or directory.

chown is for "owner" and chgrp is for "group"

I would use chown for change owner to professor like "chown cumoja1 My\ Hunger\ Games.txt
I would use chgrp as "chgrp CSC3320 My\ Hunger\ Games.txt"

3.	Copy file from /home/cumoja1/HungerGames to my directory
4.	And change name as My Hunger Games.txt
5.	Use vi editor change Haymitch Abernathy to my name
